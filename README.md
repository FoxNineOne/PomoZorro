A (Work in Progress) Pomodoro timer - with Zorro Sombre music

The timer allows you two select your own duration of work and resting timess. 
A playlist of Zorro Sombre music plays whilst the timer progresses.


Currently , you can skip and repeat songs. 

Would like to implement playlist manipulation (change order of playlists, enable/diisable songs) , volumne control for work/rest mode.


This is a bit of design nightmare at the moment, this is not a priority for me until I've completed the functionality

If you wish to skip the clocks and enjoy music alone - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUYCs32W4hL2tM9R0FJdPNg
