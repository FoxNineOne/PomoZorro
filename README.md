A (Work in Progress) Pomodoro timer - with Zorro Sombre music

Current Status can be viewed here: https://pomozorro.netlify.app/

The timer allows you two select your own duration of work and resting timess.
A playlist of Zorro Sombre music plays whilst the timer progresses.

Currently, you can: - set your times for work and rest - play, skip, stop songs from the playlist - mute audio without pausing timer - skip modes.

Would like to implement:

- playlist manipulation (change order of playlists, enable/disable songs)
- playlist on a separate modal window
- volume control (overall, and individually for work/rest mode)
- show/hide time input buttons
- have slow flashing of screen elements when on pause mode.
- have now playing information on footer bar

If you wish to skip the clocks and enjoy music alone - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUYCs32W4hL2tM9R0FJdPNg
