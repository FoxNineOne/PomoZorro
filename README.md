# PomoZorro

## Overview
PomoZorro is a Pomodoro-style productivity timer that combines focused work sessions with curated background music.

The application features original music produced from my artist alias **Zorro Sombre**, designed to support concentration during work sessions without becoming distracting.

This project is a work in progress and is being actively developed alongside my full-time role.

## Motivation
I wanted to build a productivity tool that I would personally use, while applying JavaScript fundamentals to a real, user-facing application rather than isolated exercises.

The inclusion of original music allowed me to explore audio control, user interaction, and application state in a practical way.

## Tech Stack
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

## Current Features
- User-configurable work and rest durations
- Pomodoro-style timer with work / rest cycles
- Integrated playlist of original music
- Play, pause, skip, and stop audio playback
- Mute audio without pausing the timer
- Skip between work and rest modes
- Simple, distraction-free interface

## Planned Improvements
- Playlist manipulation (reorder playlists, enable/disable tracks)
- Dedicated playlist modal
- Volume controls (global and per mode)
- Show / hide time input controls
- Visual indicators when paused (e.g. subtle flashing elements)
- “Now Playing” information in the footer

## What I Learned
- Structuring a JavaScript application beyond small scripts
- Managing timers, audio playback, and UI state together
- Designing features incrementally while balancing work and study
- Building a product that blends technical and creative elements
