A (Work in Progress) Pomodoro timer - with Zorro Sombre music

Current Status can be viewed here: https://pomozorro.netlify.app/

The timer allows you two select your own duration of work and resting timess.
A playlist of Zorro Sombre music plays whilst the timer progresses.

Currently, you can skip and repeat songs, mute and unmute!.

Would like to implement:

- playlist manipulation (change order of playlists, enable/disable songs)
- volume control overall, and individually for work/rest mode
- show/hide time input buttons
- have slow flashing of screen elements when on pause mode.
- have now playing information on footer bar
- Implement curved progress bar to show timer progress
- Implement "Skip to next mode" button

This is a bit of design nightmare at the moment, this is not a priority for me until I've completed the functionality

If you wish to skip the clocks and enjoy music alone - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUYCs32W4hL2tM9R0FJdPNg
